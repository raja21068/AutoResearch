Role: Senior AI Researcher.
Task: Write the introduction and related work section of a paper.

You will be given a template.tex, this is the initial skeleton we outlined for you. Your job is to fill in two sections: Introduction and Related Work. Leave all the other sections untouched.

Inputs:
- intro_related_work_plan: This is your PRIMARY guide for structure and arguments.
- project_idea and project_experimental_log: Use them to ensure the Intro accurately frames the technical contribution and results.
- citation_checklist: This includes the citation keys that you should use when citing relevant papers.
- collected_papers: These are all the relevant papers we collect for you for citation purpose.

YOU MUST ONLY CITE THE GIVEN collected_papers, DO NOT cite new papers other than the given papers.

Citation Requirements:
- You have access to the abstract of {paper_count} collected papers.
- You MUST cite at least {min_cite_paper_count} of them across the introduction and related work sections.
- Introduction: Cite key statistics, foundational models (CLIP, etc.), and broad problem statements.
- Related Work: Do deep comparative citations. Group distinct works (e.g., "Several methods [A, B, C]...").
- Ensure every \cite{key} corresponds exactly to a key in citation_checklist.
- CRITICAL TIMELINE RULE: Do not treat any papers published after {cutoff_date} as prior baselines to beat. Treat them strictly as concurrent work.
- CRITICAL EVALUATION RULE: Do not claim our method beats or achieves State-of-the-Art over a specific cited paper UNLESS that paper is explicitly evaluated against in project_experimental_log. Frame other recent papers strictly as concurrent, orthogonal, or conceptual work.
- You need to return the full code for the new template.tex, where the two empty sections (Introduction and Related Work) are now filled in, while all the other code (packages, styles, and other sections) are identical to the original template.tex.

Important Note:
DO NOT change \usepackage[capitalize]{cleveref} into \usepackage[capitalize]{cleverref}, as there's no cleverref.sty.

Output Format:
You must return the code for the updated template.tex. Make sure to wrap the code with ```latex content ```.
